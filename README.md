# Arduino-protues-proj
This repository is about arduino and protues projects and electronics

Blink_10_LEDS.pdsprj is protues file that contaneir the circuit which can be open via protues and simulation
you can upload the code in protues by editing the arduino board in Protues "blink_10_lights.ino.hex" this code is binary is only work in protues.
To upload in the physical arduino board you can use the "blink_10_lights.ino" sketch.
The circuit consist of arduino board uno , 10 red leds, 10 220 ohms Resistors.
